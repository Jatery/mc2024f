# Homework website for Motion Capture and Virtual Influencers Course

For those who accidentally found this repository from my github profile, this is just a course and do not overanalyze it. Please. I need the cool points.

For the professor or TAs, I've found that the youtube link for streaming videos contains a '/live/' section. You can check if the videos are streamed or recorded by the link, then the videos can kept unpublic :).
